			QUESTIONS:
				Artificial Intelligence is a SUPERSET in relation to machine learning
				Deep learning is a TYPE OF MACHINE LEARNING
			Lecture 1: Machine Learning and AI
				OBJ: Descirbe the relationship between machine learning and AI
					AI is a largetoolkit of techniques to mimic human thinking and learning
					Within AI we have:
						Machine learning
						Game Theory
						Logical Inference
						Genetic Algorithms
						Search/path planning i.e. A*
					Within ML:
						Deep learning
						DEcision TRees
						Statistical ML
						Random Forest
					"When AI works, they stop calling it AI"
					Recommendation on amazon and netflix is a form of AI
			Lecture 2: Types of ML
				OBJ:
					Classify machine learning approaches as classification or regression
					Classify machine learning approaches as feature-based or featureless
				We have done ML:
					Predicting sales based on current and previous data, we can get a regression line
					the formula of y=mx+b is a model
						adding data to change the model is called RETRAINING THE MODEL
					Parametric models mean you dont have to go back to historical data or change it
					X is called a "feature": it is used to predict something
				Deep learning is featureless: 
					can work directly on data itself
					this is important because it can be challenging to create features from data
					This has helped deep learning to become the most popular
				Featureless is best for homogenous data
					it becomes difficult when you have multiple types of data
				Classification vs. Regression:
					Classification
						model returns a discrete value
							"the species of an iris is on of { orchid,rose,xxx}
					Regression 
						returns a numerical value
				Supervised vs. Unsupervised ML:
					Supervised
						uses historucal data to make a new prediction. 
							Regression, most Deep learning techniques, SVM, decision trees, random forests
						Changes to prediction are based on retraining of the model
					Unsupervised:
						Uses the data at hand to provide some insight
							average, most anomaly detection, nearest neighbor alrorithms, clustering
						Changes to the ouput are based on calibration of the technique

		What is Data Mining?
			Data Mining: The computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets with the goal of extracting insights
				Uses methods from both machine learning and statistics
			Machine Learning: A branch of computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in AI
				Machine learning involves the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions on that data. 
				Machine learning is a central part of data mining, along with classical statitics
			Descriptive statistics: Quantitative summaries of the main features of a data set
				Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and does not assume that the data came from a larger population. 
				Descriptive stats includes the calc of measures of center, measures of spread and some basic visualizations
			Inferential Statistics
				inferential stats includes developing point estimates, confidence intervals, conducting hypothesis test and applying a variety of statistical models.
				inferential stats often use descriptive stats as a starting point
			CRISP-DM:
				Cross industry standard process for data mining:
					1. Business Understanding
						Business objectives need to be understood and identified before starting a data mining task
					2. Data Understanding
						Data miner must know how the data was obtained, the format of data, number of records and unit of measurments
					3. Data Preparation
						Determine whether to transform the data and how to handle missing values
							Can use dimensionality reduction to make the data set more manageable for analysis
					4. Modeling
						Data miner must determine whether the data set satisfies the assumption of the chosen model
					5. Evaluation
						Data miner must determine if the objective of te task was met
					6. Deployment
						Determine how the model can help achieve business objectives such as increasing profit or decreasing the number of defects in the manufacturing process

		Data Formats
			Observation: record associated with an individual entitiy, usually found in a single row
			Feature: a column containing information associated with each entity
			Three common data formats that are currently in use
				CSV
					One observation per row and features separated by a delimiter(comma)
				JSON
					JavaScript Observation Notation
				XML
					Extensible Markup Language(basically HTML) Data separated by tags <Make>Toyota</Make>

	1.6 NumPy package
		Goals:
			Understand NumPy Arrays
			relate array container nesting to array dimensions and shape
			Review array shape and math functions
			one or two dimensional arrays can be represented with ndarray
				can be created with array() function
			the shape of an array is the tuple of level sizes and is stored in the array.shape attribute i.e.[[1,2,3][1,2,3]] (2,3)
			
		All array functions may take a scalar argument instead of an array argument
		Comparison operators work with array operands
		An aggregate function does not always return exactly one value
		The variance function is not a simple function because simple functions return one value for each array element
		Simple functions
			Such as sqrt() and log()
			May have an array argument and is applied to each element and returns an array
		Aggregate function
			Such as min() max() median() var()
			returns one value for aentire array or array slice
		Matrix Function
			interprets arrays as mathematical matrices and implements matrix algebra
		Aggregate and Matrix functions work with arrays and scalars arguments, since scalar is a zero-dimensional array

	In-Class Notes
	Definitions:
		AI:
			The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence
			such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
		Machine Learning:
			the use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions
			by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data.
		Deep Learning:
			
    What is the relationship between AI, machine learning, and deep learning?
		Deep learning is within Machine Learning and Machine Learning is within AI

		Machine learning is a variation of AI
			Deep Learning is a featureless subset of Machine Learning
		Machine Learning and Deep Learning are both disciplines of AI
    What is the difference between regression and classification?
		Classification returns a discrete value such as Toyota, Red or orchid
		Regression returns a numerical value such a 1,2.3		
    What is the difference between feature-based and featureless machine learning?
		Feature-based ML uses "features" to predict future outcomes
			can have millions of features used for prediction
			breaks down data and possibly uses observations to determine data
		Featureless

Week 2: Day 1
	Before Class Notes:
		More than 40% of tim ewill be loading data and cleaning data
	Goals:
		Prepare data for use by a feature-based machine learning approach
    	Classify different features such as categorical, ordinal, or scalar.
    	Prepare data for use by a feature-based approach by standardizing values.
    	Describe techniques to clean data for use by feature-based approaches
	Types of data analysis:
		Descriptive: seeks to describe data ( based on collected data the world population in 2015 is about 7 billion)
			Descripe data to provide insight and knowledge
				Generally in the realm of unsupervised approache
		Predictive: seeks to predict data( the population iis estimated to be 11.2 billion in 2100)
			Make a prediction based on the data
				Generally in the realm of supervised machine learning approached
		Prescriptive: seeks to make decisions based on data ( population predictions for specific countries help the UN decide where to focus agricultural development)
			Make decisions based on data	
				Generally in the realm of other areas of AI(Game theory and AI planning)
	Types of values:
		When dealing with tabular data(feature based approaches) its important to consider the type of data
	Quantitative: has a numerical value (age, income, home runs)
	Categorical: based on a a set of values(gender, blood type, month)
	Bucketing changes Quantitative to Categorical data from "age" to "under 19", "35-50"
	Categorical (not measured)
		Nominal: no ordering (nominal means name only)
		Original: ordering (ex, disagree, neutral, agree)
	Quantitative (measured)
		Continuous: allows fractions
		Discrete: only natural numbers
	In 2016 the amount of data collected worldwide was around 10 zetabytes
	A zetabyte is about 1 sextillion 10^21

	Cleaning Data:
		Pandas has NaN symbol for missing data
		Imputation means to set a value to certain statistic (similar to setting to zero it depends on the domain if its successful)
		Dropping the row(drops row if its not complete) dropna
		Dropping the column:
			get rid of that feature completely ; del will delete column
